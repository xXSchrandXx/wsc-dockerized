# WSC Dockerized
(Modified for own development purposes. See original for save version https://github.com/SoftCreatRMedia/wsc-dockerized)

#### WSC (WoltLab Suite Core) in Docker

## Prerequisites

##### Linux
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

##### Windows
- [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## What's inside?

Every version is shipped with the same basic components:

- nginx
- PHP
  + exif
  + intl
  + gd (incl. WebP support)
  + imagick (using ImageMagick 7)
  + pdo_mysql
  + redis
  + opcache
- MariaDB LTS
  + 1 GB InnoDB Buffer Pool Size
- Dragonfly (redis)

Depending on the WSC version, the PHP version needs to be set in the `.env` file:

| Version           | Min. PHP-Version | Max. PHP-Version |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| WoltLab Suite 6.1 | TBA              | TBA              |
| WoltLab Suite 6.0 | PHP 8.1.2        | PHP 8.3.x        |
| WoltLab Suite 5.5 | PHP 7.4.21       | PHP 8.1.x        |
| WoltLab Suite 5.4 | PHP 7.2.24       | PHP 8.0.x        |
| WoltLab Suite 5.3 | PHP 7.0.22       | PHP 7.4.x        |
| WoltLab Suite 5.2 | PHP 7.0.22       | PHP 7.4.x        |
| WoltLab Suite 3.1 | PHP 5.5.4        | PHP 7.4.x        |
| WoltLab Suite 3.0 | PHP 5.5.4        | PHP 7.4.x        |

## Installation

The following instructions mainly refer to the installation via console. For Docker Desktop-specific instructions, please refer to the related [manual](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/dashboard/).

##### Download/Checkout

Execute the following code to download the whole project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SoftCreatR/wsc-dockerized
cd wsc-dockerized
```

##### Container setup

After checking out the desired WoltLab Suite Core version, it's time to set-up the container, but before proceeding, make sure to set-up the database credentials first. To do so, __copy__ the file `.env.example` to `.env`, and edit the file. The options are self-explanatory. This step is optional, but it is recommended to perform it, especially if you want to use a specific WSC, or PHP version.

To start the container setup, execute this command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Depending on the host machine, this process may take a few minutes (especially on Windows, using Docker Desktop)

##### WoltLab Suite Core installation

As soon as the container has been set-up successfully, you can install the WoltLab software itself. To do so, point your web browser to `http://hostname-or-ip` (e.g. `http://localhost`). You should now see something similar to this:

If this is the case: Congrats, you are nearly done. If not: Whoops. Something went wrong. Check your log files, and make sure, that you followed all steps until here. If nothing helps, [file an issue](https://github.com/SoftCreatR/wsc-dockerized/issues/new).

Click on the "Start installation" button to proceed.

Since this project is primarily aimed at developers, you probably want to set up the software in developer mode. In this case, call the `install.php` file with the parameter `dev=1`, for example `http://localhost/install.php?dev=1`.

During the installation, you might be asked for database information. It's important to know, that the database server is not reachable via `localhost`, or `127.0.0.1`, but `mysql`. It's also worth noting, that MySQL will be installed with a pre-created database, and pre-defined login information, if you didn't configure it during the container setup:

- Database name: `woltlab_suite`
- Database user: `woltlab_suite`
- Database password: `woltlab_suite`

##### Finish

You may wonder, if this was already everything, and the simple answer is:

If no errors occurred during the installation process, everything is set-up, and you can enjoy using the WoltLab software ðŸŽ‰

## FAQ

__Question:__ How can I use redis as caching method?

__Answer:__

1. Log in to the administration panel of your WoltLab Suite Core installation (e.g. `http://localhost/acp`)
2. Head over to Configuration -> General -> Cache
3. Check `Use Redis` under `Caching Method`
4. Paste `redis:6379` into the `Redis-Server` input field

## Troubleshooting

__Problem:__ redis doesn't seem to work after setting it up, it always shows "Filesystem" as cache source.
__Solution:__ The given redis server ip is invalid. Make sure, not to use `localhost`, or `127.0.0.1`. The correct hostname is `redis`.

__Problem:__
> An error has occurred while trying to connect to your database:
> 
> Connecting to MySQL server 'localhost' failed
> 
> SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] No such file or directory
> 

__Solution:__ The given MySQL hostname is incorrect. Make sure, not to use `localhost`, or `127.0.0.1`. The correct hostname is `mysql`.

__Problem:__
> An error has occurred while trying to connect to your database:
> 
> Connecting to MySQL server 'mysql' failed
> 
> SQLSTATE[HY000] [1045] Access denied for user '###'@'wsc_php-fpm_1.wsc_default' (using password: YES)

__Solution:__ The given username, and/or password, and/or database name is incorrect. If you did not set-up custom database information, the correct information is:

- Database name: `woltlab_suite`
- Database user: `woltlab_suite`
- Database password: `woltlab_suite`
